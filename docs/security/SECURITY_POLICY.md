# Security Policy for OpenFGA Operator

## Introduction

This document establishes the security policy for the OpenFGA Operator, outlining the security requirements, standards, and procedures that must be followed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the authorization infrastructure.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All OpenFGA Operator deployments
- Development, testing, and production environments
- All personnel involved in development, deployment, and operation
- Third-party integrations and dependencies

## Security Principles

### 1. Security by Design
All system components must be designed with security as a primary consideration from the initial design phase through deployment and maintenance.

### 2. Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls must be implemented to provide comprehensive protection against various attack vectors.

### 3. Principle of Least Privilege
Users, services, and applications should be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions.

### 4. Zero Trust Architecture
No entity, whether inside or outside the network perimeter, should be trusted by default.

## Access Control

### Authentication Requirements

#### Developer Authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all developer accounts
