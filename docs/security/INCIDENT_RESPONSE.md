   - Stricter access controls
   - Additional security validations

### Phase 4: Recovery (24-72 Hours)

#### System Restoration
1. **Validate Security**
   - Verify all threats removed
   - Confirm system integrity
   - Test security controls

2. **Gradual Restoration**
   ```bash
   # Example: Gradual service restoration
   kubectl scale deployment openfga-operator --replicas=1
   # Monitor for 30 minutes
   kubectl scale deployment openfga-operator --replicas=3
   ```

3. **Monitor for Recurrence**
   - Enhanced monitoring
   - Additional logging
   - Frequent security scans

#### Business Continuity
1. **Service Validation**
   - Functional testing
   - Performance validation
   - User acceptance testing

2. **Communication**

   - Prepare incident report

### Phase 5: Post-Incident Activities (1-2 Weeks)

#### Lessons Learned
1. **Incident Review Meeting**
   - What happened?
   - What went well?
   - What could be improved?
   - What actions should we take?

2. **Documentation Updates**
