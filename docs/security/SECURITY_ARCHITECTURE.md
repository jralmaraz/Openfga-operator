# Security Architecture for OpenFGA Operator

## Overview

The OpenFGA Operator implements a comprehensive security framework designed to protect against malicious code injection and ensure the integrity of deployments in Kubernetes environments. This document outlines the security design principles, protective measures, and implementation details.

## Security Design Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Admission controllers for runtime validation
- Static analysis for build-time security
- Signature verification for authenticity

### 2. Zero Trust Architecture
- No implicit trust in any component
- Continuous verification of all interactions
- Principle of least privilege enforcement

### 3. Supply Chain Security
- Git commit signature verification
- Developer authentication requirements
- Artifact integrity validation

## Security Components

### Admission Controller Framework

The OpenFGA Operator includes a sophisticated admission controller that validates deployments before they are created in the cluster.

#### Features:
- **Webhook Validation**: Intercepts and validates OpenFGA custom resources
- **Policy Enforcement**: Enforces security policies defined in ConfigMaps
- **Resource Validation**: Validates image signatures and sources
- **Runtime Security**: Checks for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations

#### Implementation:
```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingAdmissionWebhook
metadata:
  name: openfga-security-validator
spec:
  clientConfig:
    service:
      name: openfga-operator-webhook
      namespace: openfga-system
      path: "/validate"
  rules:
  - operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
    apiGroups: ["authorization.openfga.dev"]
    apiVersions: ["v1alpha1"]
    resources: ["openfgas"]
```

### Malicious Code Injection Analysis

#### Static Analysis Engine
- **Code Scanning**: Automated scanning of container images
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Integration with CVE databases
- **Policy Compliance**: Enforcement of organizational security policies

#### Runtime Protection
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitoring for suspicious activities
- **Anomaly Detection**: ML-based detection of unusual patterns
- **Automatic Remediation**: Quarantine and rollback capabilities

### Git Commit Signature Verification

#### Developer Authentication
- **GPG Signature Verification**: All commits must be signed with verified GPG keys
- **Certificate-based Authentication**: Integration with organizational PKI
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Required for sensitive operations

#### Implementation Details:
```bash
# Git hook for commit verification
#!/bin/bash
# pre-receive hook
while read oldrev newrev refname; do
    # Verify GPG signature on commits
    if ! git verify-commit $newrev; then
        echo "ERROR: Commit $newrev is not properly signed"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Verify developer authorization
    if ! verify-developer-auth $newrev; then
        echo "ERROR: Developer not authorized for this repository"
        exit 1
    fi
done
```

## Security Policies

### Container Security
- **Image Scanning**: Mandatory vulnerability scanning before deployment
- **Signed Images**: Only signed container images are allowed
- **Registry Validation**: Images must come from approved registries
- **Runtime Constraints**: Security contexts with minimal privileges

### Network Security
- **Network Policies**: Strict network segmentation between components
- **TLS Encryption**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Service Mesh Integration**: Optional Istio integration for advanced security

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All persistent data encrypted
- **Key Management**: Integration with Kubernetes secrets and external KMS
- **Access Controls**: RBAC policies for fine-grained access control

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats
1. **Malicious Container Images**: Deployment of compromised images
2. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromise of build or deployment pipeline
3. **Insider Threats**: Unauthorized access by authenticated users
4. **Network Attacks**: Man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping
5. **Configuration Drift**: Unauthorized changes to security configurations

### Mitigations
1. **Image Verification**: Signature verification and vulnerability scanning
2. **Pipeline Security**: Signed commits and authenticated developers
3. **Access Controls**: Principle of least privilege and audit logging
4. **Network Security**: TLS encryption and network policies
5. **Configuration Management**: GitOps and immutable infrastructure

## Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All security events logged and monitored
- **Tamper-proof Storage**: Logs stored in immutable storage
- **Real-time Alerting**: Immediate notification of security violations

### Compliance Standards
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Controls for security and availability
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk-based security approach

## Configuration Examples

### Security Policy Configuration
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: openfga-security-policy
  namespace: openfga-system
data:
  policy.yaml: |
    securityPolicy:
      imageVerification:
        enforced: true
        allowedRegistries:
          - "gcr.io/openfga"
          - "quay.io/openfga"
      developerAuth:
        enforced: true
        requiredSignatures: ["gpg"]
      vulnerabilityScanning:
        enforced: true
        maxSeverity: "medium"

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: openfga-admission-controller
  namespace: openfga-system

    matchLabels:
      app: openfga-admission-controller
  template:
    metadata:

        - name: TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE
          value: "/etc/certs/tls.key"
