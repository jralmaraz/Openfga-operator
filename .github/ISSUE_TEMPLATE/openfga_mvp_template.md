## Summary
This issue aims to outline the initial design and implementation of the OpenFGA MVP (Minimum Viable Product) concept and prototype. The goal is to create a functional prototype that demonstrates the core features of OpenFGA.

### Key Tasks
1. **Research and Analysis**
   - Understand the requirements for the MVP.
   - Analyze similar products and identify best practices.

2. **Design**
   - Create wireframes and flowcharts for the user interface.
   - Define the architecture of the system.

3. **Implementation**
   - Set up the development environment.
   - Develop the core features of the MVP, including:
     - Feature A
     - Feature B
     - Feature C

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for the implemented features.
   - Conduct user testing to gather feedback.

5. **Documentation**
   - Create user documentation for the prototype.
   - Document the codebase for future reference.

6. **Deployment**
   - Prepare the deployment process for the MVP.
   - Deploy the prototype to a staging environment for further testing.
