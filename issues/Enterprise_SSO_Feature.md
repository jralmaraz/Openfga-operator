## Issue: Enterprise SSO Feature

### Description
Enterprise SSO integration for the OpenFGA Kubernetes operator. This feature will enable seamless authentication and authorization for enterprise users by implementing Single Sign-On (SSO).

### Value Proposition and Business Case
- **Improves User Experience**: Simplifies the login process for users by allowing them to use existing credentials.
- **Enhances Security**: Reduces password fatigue and minimizes the attack surface by limiting the number of credentials that users need to manage.
- **Aligns with Enterprise Standards**: Ensures that the operator meets the security and access management requirements of larger organizations.

### Rationale
Enterprise environments require robust access control measures, making this integration highly appealing to larger organizations.
