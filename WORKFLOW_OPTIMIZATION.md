# GitHub Actions Workflow Optimization

## Problem Addressed
The GitHub Actions workflow was experiencing long build times (2+ hours) due to multi-platform builds being executed for all events, including pull requests.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Conditional Platform Builds
**File**: `.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml`
- **Before**: All builds (PRs, branches, tags) used multi-platform: `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`
- **After**: Conditional platform selection:
  - Release builds (v* tags): `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`
  - Non-release builds (PRs, branches): `linux/amd64` only

**Impact**: PR builds now run ~50% faster by building for single platform only.

### 2. Improved Caching Strategy
**Files**: Both workflow files
- **Before**: Single cache key without comprehensive restore-keys
- **After**: Enhanced cache strategy with multiple restore-keys:
  ```yaml
  key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
  restore-keys: |
    ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
    ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-
  ```

**Impact**: Better cache hit rates, reducing dependency compilation time.

### 3. CI Workflow Consolidation
**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Before**: 5 separate jobs (compile, build, test, fmt, clippy) with redundant setups
- **After**: 2 optimized jobs:
  - `test`: Combines formatting, linting, and testing
  - `build`: Separate build verification

**Impact**: Reduced job overhead and faster CI execution.

## Expected Performance Improvements

### PR Builds
- **Build Time**: ~50% reduction (single vs multi-platform)
- **Cache Efficiency**: Improved cache hit rates
- **Resource Usage**: Reduced GitHub Actions minutes

### Release Builds
- **Functionality**: Unchanged (still multi-platform)
- **Cache**: Better utilization across builds
- **Publishing**: Same workflow for releases

## Backward Compatibility
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Release builds still multi-platform
- ✅ Container registry publishing unchanged
- ✅ All build targets and commands work as before

## Validation
- ✅ YAML syntax validated
- ✅ Local builds tested (make compile, build, test, fmt, clippy)
- ✅ All 40 tests pass
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing workflows
