# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The OpenFGA Operator team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@openfga.dev**

Include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 7 days, high severity within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on public disclosure timing after the vulnerability is fixed

### Scope

This security policy applies to:
- The OpenFGA Operator codebase
- Official container images
- Documentation and examples
- Associated infrastructure and deployment manifests

### Security Features

The OpenFGA Operator implements multiple security layers:

#### Admission Controller Security
- Validates all OpenFGA custom resources before deployment
- Enforces security policies and compliance requirements
- Prevents deployment of unsigned or vulnerable container images
- Validates resource configurations against security best practices

#### Developer Authentication
- Requires GPG-signed commits from authenticated developers
- Implements multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Validates developer certificates and permissions
- Maintains comprehensive audit logs of all development activities

#### Container Security
- Mandatory vulnerability scanning for all container images
- Signature verification for container images
- Runtime security monitoring and anomaly detection
- Secure-by-default container configurations

#### Network Security
- TLS encryption for all communications
- Network policies for traffic segmentation
- Service mesh integration for advanced security controls
- Zero-trust network architecture

### Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.9.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.9   | :x:                |

### Security Best Practices

When deploying the OpenFGA Operator, follow these security best practices:

#### Deployment Security
1. **Use Latest Version**: Always deploy the latest supported version
2. **Network Policies**: Implement Kubernetes network policies
3. **RBAC**: Use least-privilege RBAC configurations
4. **Secrets Management**: Use Kubernetes secrets or external secret management
5. **Image Security**: Only use signed, scanned container images

#### Configuration Security
1. **Security Contexts**: Use restrictive security contexts
2. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate resource limits
3. **Admission Controllers**: Enable and configure admission controllers
4. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive security monitoring

#### Operational Security
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep the operator and dependencies updated
2. **Security Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerabilities
3. **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit logging
4. **Incident Response**: Have an incident response plan ready

### Security Architecture

The OpenFGA Operator implements defense-in-depth security:
